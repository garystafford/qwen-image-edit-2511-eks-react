Convert this exact photo into a Studio Ghibli-style illustration of the same family, keeping all people in the same positions, poses, expressions, clothing, camera angle, and background setting exactly as in the original image, just redrawn in 2D Ghibli movie style, soft hand‑painted shading, clean lines, warm colors, gentle cinematic lighting, subtle film‑like texture, no changes to composition, no added or removed objects.

Extend the existing living room photo seamlessly to the left to create a perfectly square 1:1 image, keeping all original parts of the photo completely unchanged in lighting, color, style, sharpness, and perspective, and expanding the scene by continuing the same living room environment to the left with matching wall, floor, furniture style, decor, and ambient light, as if the original photo had simply captured a wider view of the same room, highly coherent, natural, and realistic, no new people, no fantastical elements, no stylistic changes.

Extend the existing living room photo seamlessly to change the canvas from 16:9 to 3:2, keeping all original parts of the photo completely unchanged in lighting, color, style, sharpness, and perspective, and expanding the scene by continuing the same living room environment beyond the current frame with matching wall, floor, furniture style, decor, and ambient light, as if the original photo had simply captured a slightly taller and wider view of the same room, highly coherent, natural, and realistic, no new people, no fantastical elements, no stylistic changes.

Change only the color of the pink leather purse to an ochre yellow leather while keeping everything else exactly the same. Preserve the original background, lighting, shadows, reflections, texture, stitching, and material so it still clearly appears to be leather. Do not move or resize any objects, do not alter the purse on the right, and do not add or remove any elements. The only modification should be the hue of the purse, turning it into a rich, muted ochre yellow consistent with the existing shading and highlights.

Preserve the original background, lighting, shadows, reflections, texture, stitching, and material so it still clearly appears to be leather. Do not move or resize any objects, do not alter the purse on the right, and do not add or remove any elements. The only modification should be the purse's hue, turning it into a rich, muted British Racing Green, consistent with the existing shading and highlights.

Change only the color of the pink leather purse to deep burgundy while keeping everything else exactly the same.

The only modification should be the purse's hue, changing it to a rich, muted deep burgundy that is consistent with the existing shading and highlights.

Use the first image of the breakfast item only as a style and appearance reference. Replace every piece of bacon on the plate in the second image with breakfast items that match the size, shape, color, and texture of the items in the first image. Do not change the plate, eggs, toast, or any other food items, and keep the background, lighting, shadows, reflections, and camera angle exactly the same as in the second image. Generate a single edited version of the second image only.
